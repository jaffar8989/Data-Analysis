# Financial Transaction Anomaly Detection System - Complete Implementation

## Overview
This project provides a comprehensive anomaly detection framework for financial institutions, specifically designed to identify suspicious transactions, fraudulent activities, and unusual patterns in real-time transaction data. The implementation leverages unsupervised machine learning (Isolation Forest) to detect outliers such as unusually large loans, suspicious repayments, and high-risk user behavior patterns.

## Objectives
- Detect anomalous transactions using unsupervised machine learning techniques
- Flag suspicious patterns including large amounts, rapid transactions, and high-risk behaviors
- Provide real-time fraud prevention capabilities for financial applications
- Generate actionable insights and priority-based alerts for security teams
- Demonstrate best practices for anomaly detection in fintech environments
- Enable seamless integration into existing fraud prevention systems

## Prerequisites
### Python Requirements
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Required libraries:
  ```
  pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn sqlite3
  ```

### Additional Dependencies
- **Scikit-learn**: For Isolation Forest algorithm and preprocessing
- **SQLite3**: For database storage and querying
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: For comprehensive data visualization
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis

## Dataset Description
The system generates realistic transaction data with the following features:
- `transaction_id` – Unique transaction identifier
- `user_id` – Customer identifier
- `transaction_type` – Loan, Payment, or Transfer
- `amount` – Transaction amount with log transformation
- `timestamp` – Transaction date and time
- `account_age_days` – Age of customer account
- `previous_transactions` – Historical transaction count
- `time_since_last_transaction` – Hours since last activity
- `location_risk_score` – Geographic risk assessment (0-1)
- `device_trust_score` – Device security rating (0-1)
- `is_anomaly` – Detected anomaly flag (0/1)
- `anomaly_score` – Anomaly confidence score

## How to Run

### 1. Complete Analysis
```bash
python anomaly_detection_system.py
```
This will:
- Generate 5,000 realistic transaction records with embedded anomalies
- Train Isolation Forest model on transaction patterns
- Detect and analyze anomalous transactions
- Create comprehensive visualizations
- Generate fraud prevention report
- Save results to SQLite database

### 2. Custom Analysis
```python
from anomaly_detection_system import TransactionAnomalyDetector

# Initialize detector with custom contamination rate
detector = TransactionAnomalyDetector(contamination=0.05)

# Generate or load your data
df = detector.generate_sample_data(n_samples=10000)

# Fit model and detect anomalies
df = detector.fit_detect(df)

# Analyze results
anomalies = detector.analyze_anomalies(df)
```

### 3. Database Integration
```python
# Save to database for production use
detector.save_to_database(df, 'production_transactions.db')

# Query anomalies
import sqlite3
conn = sqlite3.connect('transactions.db')
anomalies = pd.read_sql("SELECT * FROM anomalies ORDER BY anomaly_score", conn)
```
