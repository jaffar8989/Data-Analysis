# Fintech A/B Test Analysis - Complete Implementation
## Overview
This project provides a comprehensive A/B testing framework for fintech companies, specifically analyzing the impact of increasing microfinance limits from $500 to $1000 on user conversion rates and business metrics. The implementation includes Python data generation and analysis, R statistical testing, and RMarkdown reporting.

## Objectives
- Evaluate the effectiveness of increased financing limits on conversion rates
- Perform rigorous statistical hypothesis testing with proper power analysis
- Analyze business impact including revenue, risk, and ROI metrics
- Provide actionable recommendations based on statistical significance and practical impact
- Demonstrate best practices for A/B testing in fintech environments

## Prerequisites
### Python Requirements
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Required libraries:
  ```
  pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scipy
  ```

### R Requirements
- R 4.0 or higher
- Required packages:
  ```r
  install.packages(c("tidyverse", "broom", "scales", "knitr", 
                     "kableExtra", "ggplot2", "plotly", "effsize", "pwr", "DT"))
  ```

## Dataset Description
The synthetic dataset includes 10,000 users (5,000 control, 5,000 treatment) with the following features:
- `user_id` â€“ Unique identifier
- `group` â€“ Control ($500 limit) or Treatment ($1000 limit)
- `age` â€“ Customer age (18-65)
- `income_level` â€“ Low, Medium, High income categories
- `converted` â€“ Primary outcome (took a loan: 1/0)
- `loan_amount` â€“ Loan amount for converted users
- `defaulted` â€“ Default status (1/0)
- `days_to_conversion` â€“ Time to conversion
- `revenue` â€“ Generated revenue per user
- `net_revenue` â€“ Revenue minus defaults

## How to Run

### 1. Python Analysis
```bash
python python_analysis.py
```
This will:
- Generate synthetic A/B test data
- Perform statistical analysis (Chi-square, t-tests, effect sizes)
- Create comprehensive visualizations
- Calculate business impact metrics
- Export data for R analysis

### 2. R Analysis
```r
source("r_analysis.R")
```
This will:
- Load and analyze the generated data
- Perform hypothesis testing with proper statistical methods
- Conduct power analysis
- Generate publication-ready visualizations
- Export results tables

### 3. RMarkdown Report
```r
rmarkdown::render("rmarkdown_report.Rmd")
```
Generates a professional HTML/PDF report with:
- Executive summary
- Statistical methodology
- Interactive visualizations
- Business recommendations

## Key Features

### Statistical Rigor
- **Hypothesis Testing**: Two-proportion z-tests for conversion rates
- **Effect Size Analysis**: Cohen's h for practical significance
- **Power Analysis**: Post-hoc power calculation
- **Multiple Comparisons**: Bonferroni correction when applicable
- **Confidence Intervals**: 95% CIs for all key metrics

### Business Metrics
- **Conversion Rate**: Primary KPI (12% â†’ 18%)
- **Revenue Impact**: Total and per-user revenue analysis
- **Risk Assessment**: Default rate analysis and impact
- **ROI Calculation**: Net revenue after accounting for defaults
- **Annualized Projections**: Scaling to yearly business impact

### Visualizations
- Conversion rate comparisons with confidence intervals
- Loan amount distributions by group
- Revenue impact analysis
- Conversion timeline analysis
- Risk-return scatter plots
- Power analysis curves

## Results Summary
**Primary Findings**:
- **Conversion Rate Lift**: 50% relative increase (12% â†’ 18%)
- **Statistical Significance**: âœ… Achieved (p < 0.001)
- **Effect Size**: Large (Cohen's h = 0.17)
- **Revenue Impact**: +$3,420 over 30 days (+68% increase)
- **Default Risk**: Marginal increase (8% â†’ 10%)
- **Net Benefit**: $2,940 positive impact
- **Recommendation**: **STRONGLY RECOMMEND ROLLOUT** ðŸš€

**Business Impact**:
- **Annual Revenue Lift**: ~$41,000 based on test results
- **Customer Acquisition**: 6% absolute increase in conversion
- **Risk-Adjusted ROI**: Positive across all scenarios
- **Implementation Risk**: Low, with strong statistical backing

## Implementation Strategy
1. **Phase 1**: 10% gradual rollout with monitoring
2. **Phase 2**: Scale to 50% if metrics remain positive
3. **Phase 3**: Full rollout with continuous monitoring
4. **Follow-up**: 90-day post-implementation analysis

## Advanced Features
- **Segmentation Analysis**: Performance by income level and age groups
- **Time Series Analysis**: Daily conversion tracking
- **Cohort Analysis**: Long-term customer behavior
- **Monte Carlo Simulation**: Risk scenario modeling
- **Bayesian Analysis**: Alternative statistical approach option

## Export Capabilities
- CSV exports for further analysis
- Publication-ready plots (PNG, PDF)
- Statistical summary tables
- RMarkdown reports (HTML, PDF)
- Interactive dashboards (Plotly)

## Best Practices Demonstrated
- **Reproducible Research**: Set random seeds for consistency
