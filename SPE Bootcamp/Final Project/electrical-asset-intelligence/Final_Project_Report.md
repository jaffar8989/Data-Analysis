### 1. **Sample Use Case**

This project focuses on the **Midstream sector** of the energy industry. Specifically, it addresses the challenge of **predicting electrical equipment failures and providing prescriptive maintenance recommendations** in gas processing and transmission facilities. The system targets critical electrical assets including transformers, motors, capacitor banks, and UPS systems that form the backbone of midstream operations.

Unlike basic predictive maintenance approaches, this project delivers a **prescriptive maintenance system** that not only predicts when failures will occur but also identifies why failures are likely, recommends specific actions to prevent them, and calculates the business impact of recommendations. This problem is critical for optimizing maintenance resources, preventing production disruptions, enhancing safety, and ensuring long-term operational reliability in gas midstream facilities.

During my internship at Bapco Gas, I observed several critical incidents that motivated this project:
- A capacitor bank failure due to harmonic distortion that wasn't detected during routine checks
- Motor bearing failures causing unexpected shutdowns  
- Transformer insulation degradation that led to emergency maintenance

These experiences align with industry data showing that electrical failures in midstream operations can cause significant operational impacts, with failure frequencies ranging from thousands to hundreds of thousands of incidents depending on the asset type.

### 2. **Problem Definition**

The primary objective of this project is to **develop an AI/ML system capable of predicting electrical equipment failures and providing actionable prescriptive recommendations** for maintenance teams in gas midstream operations. The system addresses multiple interconnected problems:

#### **Primary Classification Problem**
Classify electrical assets into health states: **"Healthy"**, **"Warning"**, and **"Critical"** based on operational parameters and historical data. This is a **multi-class classification problem** using supervised learning techniques.

#### **Anomaly Detection Challenge**
Identify subtle degradation patterns and anomalous behavior in electrical equipment that may not be captured by traditional condition-based monitoring approaches.

#### **Prescriptive Analytics Objective**
Move beyond prediction to provide specific, prioritized maintenance recommendations with:
- **When**: Optimal timing for interventions
- **Why**: Root cause identification for potential failures
- **What**: Specific actions to take (repair, replace, calibrate)
- **Business Impact**: Quantified cost-benefit analysis for each recommendation

#### **Resource Optimization Goal**
Optimize maintenance scheduling considering production impact, resource availability, cost of intervention, and failure probability using reinforcement learning techniques.

This implementation directly addresses the boot camp's focus on moving from "descriptive to prescriptive analytics" as mentioned in Session 1 materials, enabling proactive asset management and optimized maintenance strategies.

### 3. **Background**

#### **Industry Context**
The energy industry is increasingly adopting AI/ML to enhance efficiency and reduce operational costs. As noted in the boot camp materials, **AI/ML capabilities contribute significantly to this progression from descriptive to prescriptive analytics**, moving beyond just monitoring and analysis to providing predictions and actionable recommendations.

Traditional maintenance approaches in midstream operations include:
- **Reactive Maintenance**: Fixing equipment after failure (high cost, safety risks)
- **Preventive Maintenance**: Scheduled maintenance regardless of actual condition (inefficient)  
- **Predictive Maintenance**: Maintenance based on actual equipment condition (better, but still limited)
- **Prescriptive Maintenance**: Recommends specific actions to prevent failures (optimal approach)

#### **Why Electrical Assets Matter in Midstream**
Electrical systems are the backbone of midstream gas facilities. Failures can cause:
- Production shutdowns and revenue loss
- Safety incidents and regulatory non-compliance
- Equipment damage and cascading failures
- Unplanned maintenance costs and resource strain

My hands-on experience at Bapco Gas (transformer maintenance, motor checks, capacitor bank troubleshooting) provided valuable insights into the specific challenges of electrical asset management in midstream operations.

#### **Advanced AI/ML Approach**
This project leverages multiple advanced AI techniques to move beyond basic prediction:

1. **Deep Learning for Anomaly Detection**: LSTM autoencoders identify complex failure patterns in time-series sensor data
2. **Class Imbalance Handling**: SMOTE oversampling addresses rare but critical failure events
3. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Bayesian optimization for optimal model performance across asset types
4. **Reinforcement Learning**: Q-learning for maintenance scheduling optimization
5. **Prescriptive Analytics**: Recommends specific actions with business impact analysis and cost-benefit calculations

This implementation directly addresses the boot camp's Session 3 focus on midstream use cases including "anomaly detection in SCADA systems for asset integrity" and "pipeline leak detection and predictive maintenance." The approach consolidates skills acquired during the boot camp while tackling real operational challenges in the midstream energy sector.

### 4. **Data Sources**

#### **Synthetic Data Generation Strategy**
Since real operational data cannot be shared due to confidentiality requirements, I created realistic synthetic datasets based on my hands-on experience at Bapco Gas. This approach ensures the data reflects authentic operational conditions and maintenance challenges.

The **data input process** follows the crucial three-stage pipeline for AI/ML model success:

#### **Stage 1: Data Collection**
Gathering operational data from multiple sources representing four critical asset types:

| Asset Type | Parameters Tracked | Data Points | Health States | Failure Modes |
|------------|-------------------|-------------|--------------|---------------|
| **Transformers** | Oil temp, winding temp, load %, insulation resistance, partial discharge, oil quality | 1,000 days | Healthy, Warning, Critical | Insulation degradation, Partial discharge, Overheating |
| **Motors** | Vibration, current, voltage, power factor, temperature, runtime hours, bearing condition | 1,000 days | Healthy, Warning, Critical | Bearing failure, Electrical fault |
| **Capacitor Banks** | Voltage, current, power factor, harmonic distortion, temperature, discharge time, fuse status | 1,000 days | Healthy, Warning, Critical | Harmonic overload, Thermal failure |
| **UPS Systems** | Voltage per cell, temperature, load %, backup time, charger efficiency, operating mode | 1,000 days | Healthy, Warning, Critical | Battery failure, Charger issue |

#### **Stage 2: Data Cleaning (Wrangling)**
Comprehensive data preprocessing to ensure model reliability:
- **Handling missing values**: Implemented forward-fill and interpolation for sensor gaps
- **Dealing with duplicates**: Identified and removed redundant timestamp records
- **Outlier detection and treatment**: Used IQR method and domain knowledge to flag anomalous readings
- **Data type consistency**: Ensured proper datetime formatting and numerical precision
- **Error correction**: Applied domain-specific validation rules based on maintenance experience

#### **Stage 3: Data Transformation**
Converting cleaned data into optimal format for machine learning algorithms:
- **Feature scaling/normalization**: StandardScaler for numerical features to ensure equal weighting
- **Encoding categorical variables**: One-hot encoding for operational modes and equipment status
- **Feature engineering**: Created derived features that significantly improved model performance

#### **Advanced Feature Engineering**
Key engineered features inspired by actual maintenance procedures:
- **Rolling averages** (7-day): Smoothes noise while capturing degradation trends
- **Rate of change**: Detects rapid deterioration patterns technicians monitor
- **Temperature differentials**: Critical for transformer cooling system health
- **Time-based features**: Day of week, month, seasonal patterns affecting equipment performance
- **Cross-asset correlations**: Power quality interactions between capacitor banks and motors

These features were developed based on real maintenance procedures where technicians analyze trends rather than single-point measurements, significantly improving model predictive capabilities.
